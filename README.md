# DCF_Model_Python

For this project, we tried to find an easier solution to value company. We propose an automated python graphical user interface (GUI) that does all the heavy work for us.

Our coding project uses financial data from an application programming interface (API) and then computes the value of the company based on the assumptions the user enters. Our GUI allows the user the enter the ticker symbol of the company he wants to value.

As a final step, the intrinsic value is display on the GUI and compared to todayâ€™s stock price.

Below you can find a screenshot of our GUI.

Our Python code is divided in two parts.

The first part is all about coding the GUI, creating elements and placing them on the screen.

The second part is all about the implementation of two functions. The first function is about retrieving stock information. The second function is about calculating the intrinsic value.



Our valuation is based on a simple discounted free cash flow model.
Below is a screenshot of the excel calculation:
